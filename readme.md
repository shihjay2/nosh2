# NOSH ChartingSystem Installation Instructions

## Preparation:
You'll need to have the following applications/packages installed on your system prior to installation
of NOSH ChartingSystem.  If you have a LAMP (Linux-Apache-mySQL-PHP) or MAMP (Mac-Apache-mySQL-PHP) server
already set up, you are golden!

##### 1. Apache web server (needs to be running)
##### 2. MySQL database.  Make sure you remember the root password.  This will be asked during the
NOSH ChartingSystem installation. (needs to be running)
##### 3. PHP 5.4 and higher
##### 4. The following PHP modules installed and enabled:
mysql, imap, mcrypt, imagick, gd, cli, curl, soap, pear
##### 5. PERL
##### 6. Imagemagick
##### 7. PDF ToolKit (pdftk)
##### 8. cURL

## Installation
Installing NOSH ChartingSystem is easy to install if you run [Docker NOSH](https://github.com/shihjay2/docker-nosh).  NOSH and all its dependencies are already configured and installed properly.  Just deploy the Vagrant virtual machine and you're ready to start.  The previous method through Ubuntu Linux PPA's is now deprecated.  If you have access to a terminal shell for your server (any distro for Linux or Mac OS-X), you can [install NOSH](https://github.com/shihjay2/nosh2/wiki/Installation).  
The installation script automatically adds scheduled task commands (cron files) and web server configuration files to make NOSH
work seamlessly the first time.  The script also determines if your system meets all the package dependencies before installation.
For detailed information, go to the [Wiki link](https://github.com/shihjay2/nosh2/wiki/Installation).

If this is the first time using NOSH, make sure you login to NOSH ChartingSystem as admin and configure your users and clinic
parameters.  It's important to do this first before any other users use NOSH ChartingSystem; otherwise,
some features such as scheduling will not work correctly!

## Updates
Like Laravel, NOSH now utilizes [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to manage its PHP dependencies.  
Composer is automatically installed when you use the installation script (it is located in /usr/local/bin/composer).
Because the [core NOSH files](https://github.com/shihjay2/nosh2) are now served on GitHub, NOSH is self-updating daily
whenever a new commit (updated files) is uploaded.  There is no more user intervention anymore, and you get the latest and greatest
NOSH version at your fingertips!

# Notes

# How the files are organized.

NOSH is built around the Laravel 5 PHP Framework, which is a models/controllers/views (MCV) framework.
Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

## Routes
The routes.php file dictate where the URL command goes to.  Looking at the file, you'll notice that the controllers are
categorized by an access control list (ACL) based on the type of user priviledges a user has when he/she is logged in to NOSH.

## Controllers
As is standard with the Laravel framework, main guts of the system lie in the ../app/Http/Controllers directory.  Looking at the
routes.php file, you'll notice that the type of controllers are categorized between AJAX and non-AJAX functions (hence they
are named with a prefix of Ajax).  Furthermore, the main controller files (CoreController.php, ChartController.php) are determined based on whether the functions are patient related or practice related.  As is also standard with the Laravel framework, middleware in the ../app/Http/Middleware directory govern any checks/filters prior to calling a function in each controller.

## Views
The view files, PDF, and email template files are in the ../resources/views directory.  The view files are essentially "modules" that
are added on depending on the needs of the view layout.
The corresponding javascript files (named the same as the view file, but with a .js extension) are in the ../public/assets/js directory.
If you see the javascript, you will notice that jQuery is used heavily here.  There are numerous plugins for jQuery that are
referenced in the header file.  Below is a list of the major jQuery plugins that are used:
##### Javascript library: [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
##### Bootstrap user interface: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
##### Calendar system: [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io)
##### Signature capture: [Signature Pad](http://thomasjbradley.ca/lab/signature-pad)
##### Graphs and Charts: [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com)
##### Form input masking: [Masked Input](https://github.com/digitalBush/jquery.maskedinput)
##### Image editing: [jCanvas](https://projects.calebevans.me/jcanvas)
##### Family Tree: [Sigma](https://sigmajs.org)

## Resources
In addition to views, other resources such as CPT codes, supplements list, CVX codes, immunizations recommendations, and growth chart plotting data are stored in either CSV or YAML format.  These files will or can be updated from time to time based on available updates.

## Assets
Images indicated in the view files reside in the ../public/assets/images directory.
CSS files reside in the ../public/assets/cs directory
Imported files are usually downloaded via script in the ../import directory.

## Database schema
